# Online-Hostel-Management
    As the name specifies HOSTEL MANAGEMENT SYSTEM is a software developed for managing various activities in the hostel. For the past few years the number of educational institutions are increasing rapidly. Thereby the number of hostels are also increasing for the accommodation of the students studying in this institution. And hence there is a lot of strain on the person who are running the hostel. This particular project deals with the problems on managing a hostel and avoids the problems which occur when carried manually.
